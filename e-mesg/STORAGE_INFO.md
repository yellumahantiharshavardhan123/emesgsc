# Firebase Storage - FREE TIER Available! 📦

## ✅ **Firebase Storage IS Free!**

**Spark Plan (Free) Includes:**
- 📁 **5 GB stored** (plenty for demo)
- ⬇️ **1 GB/day downloads**  
- ⬆️ **20,000 uploads/day**
- 📥 **50,000 downloads/day**

This is **more than enough** for your messaging app demo!

## 🔧 **How to Enable Storage (Free):**

1. **Go to Firebase Console** → Your project (`emesg-mvp-sc`)
2. **Click "Storage" in left sidebar**
3. **Click "Get started"**
4. **Select "Start in test mode"** ← This enables the FREE tier
5. **Choose same location as Firestore**
6. **Click "Done"**

## 💡 **Why You Might Think It's Not Free:**

- The pricing page can be confusing
- You might need to add a billing account (but won't be charged)
- The "test mode" wording is misleading - it's actually the free tier

## 🚀 **Alternative: Run Without Storage**

If you want to skip file uploads for now, I can modify the app to work without Storage:
- Use profile photos from Google Auth
- Disable status image uploads
- Keep text-only features

**Which would you prefer:**
1. **Enable Storage** (recommended - it's free!)
2. **Skip Storage** for now (text-only version)
